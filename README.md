# Plot Coronavirus (COVID-19) Case on world map using Eikon Data API (Python)
Would you like to know the number of COVID-19 cases around the world at a glance? You can get COVID-19 latest case from Eikon Data API using Python then plot graphs on world map using matplotlib and geopandas for % of total case, new case, death compared to each country's population

## Pre-requisites:
1. To run examples in this article, I'll be using Jupyter notebook on Miniconda
2. The Refinitiv Eikon or Workspace must be run properly on the machine.
You may contact your Refinitiv's representative to help you to access Refinitiv workspace/Eikon.
3. The application key is required to connect to Refinitiv Eikon or Workspace. To generate the application, please refer to the [Eikon Data API Quick Start Guide](https://developers.refinitiv.com/en/api-catalog/eikon/eikon-data-api/quick-start)
## Environment
- Python version 3.9.7
- Required Python Packages: eikon 1.1.12, pandas 1.3.1, matplotlib 3.4.2, geopandas 0.9.0, pycountry
